# uci-class-checker
A bot that registers for classes at UCI. The bot parses WebSoc using BS4 to determine whether a class is open. Attempts will be made to register for the course through WebReg using Selenium. 

This bot was built in 2020. As it is dependent on parsing HTML, any changes to UCI's website will affect the usability of this program.

The intention of this project was to practice making HTTP requests and using external libraries.
